**JSON dumps configuration file**

Next is an example of a configuration file, which can be used as a template:
```json
{
  db: {
    "host": "localhost",
    "name": "appform",
    "user": "gcomesana",
    "pwd": "appform"
  },

  server: {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8080,
    "app": "admtool",
    "servicePath": "datadump"
    user: 'mmarquez',
    pass: 'mmarquez'
    authPath: '/jsp/j_security_check'
  },

  dumps: [{
    "prj": "ISBlaC",
    questionnaire: "Aliquots_SP_New",
    group: "spain",
    section: 3,
    repd: false,
    out: ""
  }, {
    "prj": "PanGen-Eu",
    questionnaire: "QES_Spain",
    group: "spain",
    section: 3,
    repd: 1,
    out: ""
  }, {
    "prj": "PanGen-Eu",
    questionnaire: "QES_Espa√±ol",
    group: "Hospital del Mar",
    section: 3,
    repd: false,
    out: ""
  }]
}
```
The file is a "*dirty-json*" file, which means it doesn't have to fit the JSON strict requirements about double quotes and commas.

- *authPath* this is the authorization path for the application, necessary to authentify user and his/her password

**dumps** section is where you define which data you want to retrieve. This is a list of dump parameters, which are:
